GIT COMMAND CHEAT SHEET
cd [folder name] : goes into a folder that is in your current folder. Git always starts in C:/Users/[yourname].
dir : shows the contents of your current folder.
cd .. : brings you outside of the folder that you were inside
 
git pull : if others have made changes, run this command in the repository folder to get those changes.
git clone [link] : used to get a folder for the repository.

HOW TO PUSH:
Make sure you're in the main folder in order to push (2021-website-2, scouting_system_2022)
git add --all
git commit -m "put a message here that describes what you did"
git push (have to run previous 2 cmds)

If you get an error trying to push, make sure you have all the latest changes!

If you do not have git bash, look up "git bash downloads" and it should be the first thing there. When installing, make sure Notepad++ is the default editor. Everything else is okay as is.

*If nothing works, type cd and nothing else. Hopefully that will fix it.*
